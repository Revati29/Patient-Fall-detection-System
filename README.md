Falls are a significant public health concern, particularly among older adults. Falls can cause serious injuries, including fractures, head injuries, and other trauma, and can lead to hospitalization, long term disability, and even death. In fact, falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults. Therfore, fall detectors are necessary to prevent falls. The fall detector using accelerometer and Thinkcloud is a device that is designed to detect falls in the elderly or individuals with a high risk of falls. The device uses an accelerometer to measure the acceleration of the individual and determine whether a fall has occurred. Accelerometer can be worn as a belt on a individualâ€™s chest or wristband. The device also utilizes ThinkCloud, a cloud computing platform, to process the data collected by the accelerometer. ThinkCloud allows for a real-time data analysis and can alert caregivers or emergency services if a fall is detected. This system provides a relaible and efficient means of detecting falls,which can be critical in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of individuals at risk of falls.
